⏳✨ Pixel Study Timer 🎮📚

Pixel Study Timer isn’t just a boring stopwatch—it’s your ✨retro productivity sidekick✨. Built with a pixel-art aesthetic, this project turns studying, coding, or working into something that feels way less like a chore and way more like you’re grinding XP in an old-school game.

We all know focus is hard (shoutout to doomscrolling 🙃), but with this timer, you’re basically gamifying your grind. Think of it as study sessions = quests, breaks = power-ups, and your goals = boss battles. Instead of fighting time, you’re teaming up with it.

🚀 Features

🎨 Pixel aesthetic vibes – retro, minimal, and nostalgic (because who doesn’t love 8-bit energy?)

⏰ Pomodoro & custom timers – perfect whether you’re a hardcore 25/5 Pomodoro fan or someone who needs their own rhythm

🌱 Progress tracking – watch your focus time grow like XP on a progress bar

🔥 Distraction-free & aesthetic – no ads, no clutter, just focus-core vibes

🕹️ Feels like a game – studying = less pain, more pixels

🧠 Why though?

Because staying focused in 2025 is harder than explaining memes to your parents. The internet wants you to scroll forever, your brain wants dopamine, and deadlines are always out for blood. Pixel Study Timer makes it easier to resist by giving you:

A tool that looks fun enough that you actually want to use it

A structure (Pomodoro method) that’s scientifically proven to help focus

A little hit of ✨aesthetic motivation✨ every time you log study hours

Basically: productivity, but make it ✨retro-cute✨.

🎯 Who’s it for?

Students cramming for exams (we’ve all been there 😵‍💫)

Coders grinding LeetCode or side projects 🖥️

Writers, artists, or anyone who needs deep work ✍️

Basically… if your attention span has been nerfed by the internet, this timer is for you.

⚡ How to Use

Clone this repo (git clone https://github.com/your-username/pixel-study-timer)

Open it up in your environment of choice

Set your timer (Pomodoro or custom)

Hit start → Focus like your GPA depends on it (because it probably does)

Breaks = grab snacks, vibe check, stretch, scroll TikTok guilt-free 🧃✨

🌟 Final Notes

Pixel Study Timer is built to remind you that focus doesn’t have to be boring.
It’s not about working harder—it’s about working smarter while keeping your sanity intact.

So yeah… let’s make productivity fun again. 🚀💻
